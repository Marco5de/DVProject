\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The goal of this report was the reproduction of the results the original paper presented.
This was partly achieved as presented in section~\ref{subsec:evaluation}.
For smaller batch sizes the expected behaviour of group norm was achieved whereas for larger batch sizes the performance deteriorated unexpectedly.
However, the main use case for employing group normalization are models with a large memory footprint which certainly was not the case for the used model.
During my bachelor thesis on Depth Estimation using CNNs I experimented with the usage of group normalization as training was conducted on a single GPU.
However, I was unable to adapt the model such that I would achieve similar performance when using group normalization.
For many other tasks including the tasks evaluated in the paper, group normalization offers the possibility of training with a significantly smaller batch size that enables researches to experiment with higher capacity models.
